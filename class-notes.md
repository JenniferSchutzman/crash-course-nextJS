NEXTJS Notes

a React frontend framework
created by Vercel
enables functinoliaty such as server-side rendering and static site generation
note comparable to a frontend frameowrk like angular
but also not comparable to a backend framework like Express
removes the need for react-router
removes the need for express
it builds on top of React to give you additional features
good for production apps bc need more power
SERVER SIDE RENDERING

> unlike a traditional React app where the entire application is loaded and rendered on the client,
> NextJS allows the first page load to be rendered by the server, which is great for SEO & peformance
> create-react-app blocks SEO intellegance because rendered client side
> but still get a quick load and routing like in React
> API Routes (if you want, you can still use Express or a headless backend like Sanity if you want)
> Static Site generation
> donâ€™t need a server
> similar to Gatsby
> out of the box TypeScript & Sass
> Easy deployment
